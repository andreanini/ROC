Description: This package contains a set of routines that can compute various
 performance measures related to Receiver Operating Characteristic curves, 
 including NIST style speaker recognition evaluation
 system output.  The routines in this package allow
 - General ROC related:
 -- computing essential ROC statistics
 -- calculation of EER, minCllr and Cllr
 -- plotting of ROC curves
 -- computing the optimal score-to-log-lihelihood-ratie mapping
 - NIST SRE related:
 -- trial key info for SRE 2006, 2008 and EVALITA 2009
 -- flexible plotting of DET curves
 -- adding legends to the plot in the order of the EER
 -- plotting Applied Probability of Error (APE)-plots, with proper legend
 -- plotting of Normalized Bayes Error rate (NBE) plots
 -- merging of meta-information to the scores, and manipulation of
    these tables
 -- conditioning trials on meta-information 
 -- weighting trials based on a chosen conditioning, before calculation
    of DET parameters and performance metrics.  
 -- tippet plot
 -- normalized Bayes error rate plot
